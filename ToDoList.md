# TO DO

- [x] Movie Details page
- [x] Login

    1- [x] The user shouldn’t be able to see the catalog unless he’s logged in.
    2- [x] If the user is already logged in he can't access the the Login page again or the register page
          by URL.
    3- [] If the user tries to acces a movie details the guard will prevent him if he not logged 
         what I want is when the user logs in in that situation he goes to the movie details directle not the catalog screen
